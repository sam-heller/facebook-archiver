# facebook-archiver
Utility to archive facebook discussion threads and conversations

## Setup
* run `bundle install` to install the required gems
* Download the chromedriver from https://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/index.html and place it somewhere in your path (/usr/bin/local on OS X or linux, no clue what you windows folks do)
* update config.example.yml with your facebook username and password and rename it to config.yml


## Running
Don't. this totally doesn't work...like...at all right now.

Duh.
